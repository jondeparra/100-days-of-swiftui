// MARK: Summary: Structs

/*
 - You can create your own structs using the struct keyword.
 - Structs can have their own properties and methods.
 - If a method modifies properties of its struct, it must be mutating.
 - Structs can have stored properties and computed properties.
 - We can attach didSet and willSet property observers to properties.
 - Swift generates an initializer for all structs using their property names.
 - You can create custom initializers to override Swiftâ€™s default.
 - Access control limits what code can use properties and methods.
 - Static properties and methods are attached directly to a struct.
