// MARK: Summary: Conditions and loops

/*
 - We use if, else, and else if statements to check conditions.
 - You can combine conditions using || and &&.
 - switch statements can be easier than using if and else if a lot, and Swift will check that they are exhaustive.
 - The ternary conditional operator lets us check WTF: What?, True, False.
 - for loops let us loop over arrays, sets, dictionaries, and ranges.
 - while loops create loops that continue running until a condition is false.
 - We can skip loop items using continue or break respectively.
